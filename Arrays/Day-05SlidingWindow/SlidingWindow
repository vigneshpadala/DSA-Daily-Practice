Sliding Window is used when the problem asks about:

Subarray / Substring

Contiguous elements

Maximum / Minimum / Count / Sum within a range

Instead of recalculating again and again (❌ O(n²)),
we slide a window over the array/string (✅ O(n)).

-TYPES OF SLIDING WINDOW:

1️⃣Fixed Size Sliding Window
Window size = constant (k)
Example: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size k

2️⃣ Variable Size Sliding Window
Window size changes based on condition.
Example: Smallest Subarray with Sum ≥ S
